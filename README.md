# DS785_Capstone
Source Code contributing to the Finlon 2023 UWMSDS DS785 Capstone Project.

*The allbatter_project and allpitcher_project scripts were run prior to the main script to obtain the unique batter and pitcher Statcast IDs csv file. With the provided csv files, only the main script needs to be run to reproduce the Capstone results.

*xwOBA folder includes corresponding R shiny app of slightly altered project (including more batter data), also available at https://ayyfinn.shinyapps.io/xwoba/
